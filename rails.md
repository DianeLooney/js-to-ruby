# Rails Overview
## Ruby Phrases
Solidus - ecommerce gem
Easypost - shipping gem, integrated into solidus
Spree - ecommerce platform, the upstream of solidus, a lot of solidus code will be Spree ns
JSONAPI::Resource - class that defines an API endpointâ€™s behavior, CRUD-ish

## Patterns
Database binding is handled by schema.rb
Modifying schema.rb is done with a db migration
There is a tool to generate db migrations, and to apply them

Rails implements MVC

*Models* are classes, instances of each class correspond to a row of a table usually
Models that extend ActiveRecord usually behave similarly
ActiveRecords have a reload method to refresh the row contents from the db
To modify an ActiveRecord, you must specifically update it with a method
ActiveRecord singletons have helper methods to get things by id, by an index, or to create new instances
(c/o specific) as long as contentful data is cached, it should be treated as read-only data

*Views* are implemented as cells
Cells consist of a template file, a cell controller, and optional dependencies
The template file is `*/*.slim`
The controller is `*_controller.rb`
The optional dependencies are `*/*.[scss|js]`
Cells can have multiple templates, usually from `[show|index|edit]`
Cell controllers are not the typical C in MVC, but simply helpers to make sure the templates get rendered with the data they need
Cells can drop in react components from the javascript library. Some cells are completely empty aside from the element to host the react component

*Controllers* are implemented with controllers
One of the common patterns is to define a common mutation (perhaps complete checkout, register user, complete survey), and then define the functionality of that mutation in a class, instantiate that class with the properties required by the mutation, and then have a perform method that executes the mutation

*Administrate* is an admin dashboard tool.
Generally, if you just need to get a quick admin interface up, it will be good for that. Lots of code generation and easy customization

*Assets* are stored in multiple places.
* `app/assets` is for application-specific assets
* `lib/assets` are for assets that are related closely to the app, but not integral
* `vendor/assets` are for modifying how gems look

*Routing*
`config/routes.rb`
There is a rake command to see everything getting routed by rails.
